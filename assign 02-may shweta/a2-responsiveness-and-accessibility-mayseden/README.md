# ASsignment 2
# Document the category of issues that you identified through the manual and automated analysis above

Manual
	We identified images which had the same text for alternative text and title. There were images that did not have a comprehensive explanation on what the image contained.
	We also identified colours that were did not stand out due to lack of contrast. 

Automated
	The website identified where there a lack of and possible heading. It detected redundent issues like links. 

# What kinds of changes did you have to make (I do not want a list here). Generalize the types of issues that you created when building your website, and then the general type of changes that you made to resolve those issues.

	We added new elements like header and improve on the description of attributes. We also swapped for better display option like higher contrast of colour for clear view.

	We kept the "redundent" links on page 1 as we wanted to implement a link that goes directly to a specific area on another page but were unable to do so.


# How do these accessibility changes connect with the Gestalt principles we discussed earlier this semester?

	The colour and headings of the texts play a part in continunity and closure. As the colour continues, it is easy to see that the topic at hand is the same. When the colour changes and a larger sized heading element is seen, it can be perceived that a new subject is about to begin.

	Proximity of certain elements are also taken into account so that redundant elements, like links that point to the same website, would be removed. This prevents confusion as separate items should refer to separate places, especially when they are close together. Users may be confused as to why they point to the same place.

# Part 2
> This is where you should describe how the Gestalt principles apply to your site

1. Proximity

	In page1.html, our website's navigation menu items are placed close together, implying that they are related and belong to the same group and this group is basically information or more information. You would notice that the same principle is applied to both CEO's information in the "About Us" section.

	![alt text](images/gestalt/proximity%202.png) 

2. Similarity

	In page2.html, we decided to make use of consistent styling for the chip descriptions, including the same font, color, and layout. Each chip's section has a similar structure, with an image on one side and a description on the other. This similarity in design will help users to quickly identify and compare the different chips.
	![alt text](images/gestalt/Similarity.png) 

3. Continuity

	In page3, we tried to incoproate the layout of the page so that it maintains a logical flow from the event announcement to the details, followed by the registration form, then what we envision for our dream chips and finally the Instagram posts. This continuity will help users to navigate the contents we have smoothly. Also, we uses headings and subheadings; which contributes to this flow.
	![alt text](images/gestalt/Continuity.png) 


4. Closure

	In page3.html, we applied the use of checkboxes with images which allow users to express their intentions about attending the event. The images of "yes" and "no" help users quickly understand their options and completing the interaction.
	![alt text](images/gestalt/Closure.png) 

5. Symmetry

	In page2.html, we employed alternating sides for the chips and their descriptions while maintaining a consistent table arrangement in terms of colors, size, font, and style. The symmetrical layout of the table fosters a sense of balance, making it easier to identify and categorize the items. Additionally, the uniform color of similar items gives users a perception of stability and orderliness.
	![alt text](images/gestalt/Symmetry.png) 

6. Figure/Ground

	![alt text](images/gestalt/figure.PNG)

	In page1.html, we distinguished the chips from the overall background (the table and plain red backdrop) by changing the chip background color when users hover their mouse over it. This helps users concentrate on the content of the smaller, brightly colored background of the blurred chips. The chips are also of a fixed size and do not overlap with others, ensuring that users can easily identify the specific chip being referenced.
	
7. Common Fate

	![alt text](images/gestalt/common.PNG)

	In page3.html, the items in the registration section are arranged vertically with a consistent design: a label on the left followed by an input box for users to enter their information. This uniform design and placement encourage users to perceive all the input fields as interconnected, forming a cohesive group. Recognizing the registration section as a single unit will facilitate easier navigation through the website and reduce confusion.

ASSIGNMENT 2 

# Accessibility Improvements

## Manual Analysis
During the manual analysis, the following categories of issues were identified:
- **Color Contrast:** Several elements had insufficient contrast ratios, making text difficult to read.
- **Alt Text:** Some images were missing alt attributes, hindering screen reader users.


## Automated Analysis
Using the WAVE tool, additional issues were identified:
There were identified 1 Suspicious alternative text, 1 Broken for the same-page link, 3 Redundant title text and 1 Layout table

## Changes Made
To address the identified issues, we made changes by adjusting the text colors mostly to black, to ensure text is legible against its background, and also provided descriptive alt attributes for all relevant images.


## Connection to Gestalt Principles
The accessibility changes connect with Gestalt principles in the following ways:
- Figure-Ground: Improved color contrast helps distinguish foreground content from the background.
- Similarity: Consistent use of design elements makes the interface more predictable and easier to navigate.
- Proximity: Grouping related elements together such as form fields and their labels,improves understanding and navigation.

Closure:

Clearly defined and well-labeled elements allow users to perceive incomplete shapes or elements as complete, which can reduce confusion and improve the overall user experience.

Continuity:

A predictable and structured layout guides the user’s eye smoothly from one section to the next, making it easier for them to follow and understand the content flow.

Common Fate:

Interactive elements like buttons and links that are styled and behave consistently are perceived as part of the same group, reinforcing their functionality and making them easier to use.

Symmetry:

Balanced and symmetrical layouts create a sense of harmony and order, making the interface more aesthetically pleasing and easier to navigate.

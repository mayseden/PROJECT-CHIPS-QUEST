 Chips, Design, and Accessibility

A Responsive & Accessible Web Project

Project Overview

This project is a responsive and accessibility-focused website centered around chips (the food, not data).
While the topic is fun and familiar, the goal of this project was serious: to design and build a website that is usable, inclusive, and accessible across devices and user needs.

The site demonstrates how thoughtful front-end design choices can improve usability for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

 Project Objectives

Practice responsive web design for different screen sizes

Apply web accessibility principles (WCAG-aligned)

Build a clean, user-friendly interface using semantic HTML

Ensure the site remains usable and readable across devices

 Technologies Used

HTML5 (semantic structure)

CSS3 (responsive layouts and styling)

Media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop views

Accessibility Features

This project intentionally incorporates accessibility best practices, including:

Semantic HTML elements for improved screen reader navigation

Clear visual hierarchy and readable typography

Sufficient color contrast for readability

Responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes

Keyboard-friendly navigation considerations

Accessibility was treated as a core design requirement, not an afterthought.

📱 Responsive Design

The website was designed to function smoothly on:

Desktop screens

Tablets

Mobile devices

Layouts, spacing, and text sizing adjust dynamically to maintain usability and visual clarity across viewports.

Why Chips?

Using a familiar and lighthearted topic made it easier to focus on design principles rather than content complexity.
This allowed the project to highlight how accessibility and responsiveness can be applied to any subject — from fun food topics to real-world applications.

What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

Designing with accessibility in mind from the start

Writing clean, semantic HTML

Creating responsive layouts without sacrificing usability

Balancing visual design with functional requirements

These skills directly translate to building inclusive, user-centered digital experiences.
